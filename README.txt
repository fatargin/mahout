Welcome to Apache Mahout!

Mahout is a scalable machine learning library that implements many different approaches to machine learning.  The project
 currently contains implementations of algorithms for classification, clustering, genetic programming and collaborative filtering, all
 enabled to scale by leveraging the power of Hadoop's Map-Reduce (http://hadoop.apache.org) implementation.
